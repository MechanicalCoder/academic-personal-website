I am a graduate student at Virginia Tech pursuing my master's in Mechanical Engineering. I am specializing in RADS (Robotics, Autonomous, and Dynamical Systems) thrust area. My primary interest lies in Guidance, Navigation, and Control of unmanned aerial and space robotic systems. Currently, I am a part of SpaceDrones Lab where I am working on autonomous robotic platforms for On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing. My aim is to develop robust system identification technique to facilitate data-driven control system design.
