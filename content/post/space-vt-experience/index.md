Summary: Documenting my MS research journey at SpaceDrones Lab

## Prologue
After leaving ACSL (Advanced Control Systems Lab) in December 2021 due to incompatibility with the professor, I started looking for a new lab to conduct my MS research work. I contacted a few professors in the Mechanical and AOE (Aerospace & Ocean Engineering) department whose research work I liked but they either didn't have the vacancy or the funding for assistantship. Although I was getting desperate to find a suitable lab, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise as I was able to find the place where I wanted to be. In February 2022, I approached the co-director of Space@VT stating my desire to work in space technology. I had attended almost all the Space@VT seminars in the previous semester (probably the only graduate student to do so), so I had a fair idea about the kind of research work going on there. 

Leaving ASCL put me in a position where I wanted to find the right balance between my dreams of working in space technology and the availability of such a position, which would be a challenge given my status of being an international student. The senior leadership at Space@VT were really supportive and after a video call with [Dr. Leon Harding](https://hume.vt.edu/about/personnel-directory/leon-harding.html), I was given a list of ongoing project works. I sent them a list of my choices in the order of preference and then I was told to approach Marco and Minzhen working in the [SpaceDrones Lab](https://spacedrones.aoe.vt.edu/) in Randolph Hall 26. It was one of the few declassified labs under AOSD (Aerospace and Ocean Systems Division) of the [National Security Institute](https://nationalsecurity.vt.edu/) and a part of Space@VT. 

When I first entered the lab on February 21, Marco and Minzhen were watching a Falcon 9 launch on one of the monitors from earlier that morning and immediately, I felt at home. This was the place for me and these were the kind of people I wanted to be with. Working here has been a wonderful experience so far. There has been little oversight from the professor, given he was on sabbatical but this freedom also allowed me to chart my own course and decide on a research topic. The big vision of our lab is to develop technology for autonomous orbital servicing and assembly operations. I have decided to do my master's thesis on performing system ID and designing robust and optimal control system for the current free-floating hexacopter drone platform we are using to test our computer vision and neural network architecture.
